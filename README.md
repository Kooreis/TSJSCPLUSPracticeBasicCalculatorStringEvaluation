# Question: How can you implement a basic calculator that evaluates a string with +, -, *, / and parentheses? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided implements a basic calculator that evaluates a string containing numbers, the four basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), and parentheses. The code defines a function named 'evaluate' that takes an expression as an argument. Inside this function, an object named 'operators' is defined to map each operator to its corresponding arithmetic operation. The 'parse' function is defined to parse the string and apply the operators in the correct order of operations. It first checks for '+' or '-' from the end of the string and applies the corresponding operation if found. If not, it checks for '*' or '/' and applies the corresponding operation. If no operator is found, it converts the string to a number. The 'evaluate' function then checks for parentheses in the expression. If parentheses are found, it extracts the content within the innermost parentheses, evaluates it using the 'parse' function, and replaces the parenthetical expression in the original string with the result. This process is repeated until no parentheses are left in the expression. Finally, the 'parse' function is called on the expression to evaluate any remaining operations. The result is then returned.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript solution uses a class-based approach to solve the problem, which is a feature not available in JavaScript. It encapsulates the calculator logic within a `Calculator` class, which has methods to tokenize the expression, check if a token is an operator, get the priority of an operator, and process an operator. This makes the code more organized and easier to understand.

The TypeScript solution also uses type annotations to ensure type safety. For example, the `calculate` method is annotated to take a string as input and return a number. This can help prevent type-related bugs.

The TypeScript solution uses a different algorithm to solve the problem. Instead of using recursion to parse the expression like the JavaScript solution, it uses a stack to evaluate the expression. This approach is more efficient and can handle larger expressions without causing a stack overflow.

The TypeScript solution also handles unary minus differently. It treats it as multiplication by -1, which simplifies the code.

In terms of language features, the TypeScript solution uses array methods like `push`, `pop`, and `indexOf`, which are also available in JavaScript. However, it also uses the `private` keyword to restrict access to certain properties and methods, which is a feature not available in JavaScript.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a stack to evaluate the string expression. It iterates over the string, and when it encounters a number, it multiplies the current number by 10 and adds the new digit (after converting it from a character to an integer). When it encounters an operator or reaches the end of the string, it checks the previous operator (stored in the variable `sign`) and performs the corresponding operation: if the operator was '+', it pushes the number onto the stack; if it was '-', it pushes the negative of the number onto the stack; if it was '*' or '/', it pops the top number from the stack, performs the operation with the current number, and pushes the result back onto the stack. After iterating over the entire string, it sums up all the numbers in the stack to get the final result.

The C++ version does not handle parentheses, unlike the JavaScript version. It also does not follow the correct order of operations: it performs multiplication and division immediately, but delays addition and subtraction until the end. This means that it will give incorrect results for expressions like "2+3*4", which should be evaluated as "2+(3*4)" according to the order of operations.

The C++ version uses several language features and methods that are different from the JavaScript version:

- It uses the `isdigit` function to check if a character is a digit. The JavaScript version does not need to do this because it uses the `parseFloat` function, which automatically stops parsing the string when it encounters a non-digit character.
- It uses a stack to store intermediate results. The JavaScript version does not need to do this because it uses recursion to evaluate the expression in the correct order.
- It uses a `for` loop to iterate over the string. The JavaScript version uses a `for` loop in the `parse` function, but it also uses the `includes` and `match` methods to handle parentheses.
- It uses the `getline` function to read the string from the user. The JavaScript version does not need to do this because it is a function that takes the string as a parameter.
